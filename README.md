#  Fairness-Aware Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook developed as part of the M507A module, focusing on identifying and mitigating bias in machine learning models. The project uses the **Adult Income dataset** to demonstrate how unfair outcomes can arise in predictive modeling, and how fairness-aware techniques can help address them.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to:

- Investigate potential **bias** and **unfairness** in ML outcomes
- Apply **fairness metrics** to evaluate the model
- Implement **bias mitigation** strategies
- Assess the **business and societal impact** of fair vs. unfair models

---

## 🧠 Dataset Used

- **Name**: Adult Income Dataset (a.k.a. "Census Income")
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Description**: Predict whether an individual earns more than $50K/year based on demographic attributes.
- **Sensitive Attribute**: Gender (Male vs. Female)

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Fairness and accuracy often conflict — tradeoffs must be carefully balanced.
- Preprocessing methods can help improve fairness without significantly degrading performance.
- Ethical ML requires not just technical accuracy but **social responsibility**.
